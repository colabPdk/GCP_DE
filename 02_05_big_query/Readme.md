# Google BigQuery

This is a simple example of how to create big query tables and run queries using the Google BigQuery API using Python.

```bash
pip install google-cloud-bigquery
```

2. To write data to the table run `python write_data.py`
3. To run a query on the table run `python run_query.py`

Voila! You have successfully created a table in BigQuery and ran a query on it using Python
